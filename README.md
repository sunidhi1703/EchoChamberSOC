# Machine Learning Fundamentals- What Iâ€™ve Covered So Far

## Python Basics
I began with learning the fundamentals of Python â€” understanding data types, variables, loops, and functions. I also practiced writing conditional logic, working with lists and dictionaries, and performing basic string operations. 

## NumPy
Next, I explored NumPy, where I practiced creating and reshaping arrays, using operations like slicing, masking, and broadcasting. I also experimented with vectorized mathematical operations, aggregations like mean and sum, and performed matrix multiplications. 

## Pandas
In Pandas I learned how to create DataFrames, read CSVs, handle missing data, and perform filtering, sorting, and grouping operations. I explored `.loc` and `.iloc` for selecting rows/columns, merged datasets, and cleaned messy data to prepare it for analysis. 

## Matplotlib
I used Matplotlib to visualize data through line plots, bar graphs, histograms, and scatter plots. I also learned to customize visuals using labels, legends, colors, and subplots to make them presentation-ready. Plotting my data helped me understand patterns and distributions much faster than looking at raw tables. 

## Andrew Ngâ€™s Machine Learning
This was my first deep dive into the theory behind machine learning. I learned the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, understood how models minimize cost functions using gradient descent, and explored key concepts like bias, variance, and overfitting and underfitting.

## Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
I studied how a neural network works by mimicking biological neurons using layers and weights. I understood the flow of data from the input layer through hidden layers to the output, and how each layer applies transformations. I also explored how forward propagation computes predictions, while backpropagation helps update weights using the chain rule. Also learnt about activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, and softmax.

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
RNNs introduced the idea of memory and how previous time steps influence future predictions â€” something essential for tasks like text generation or stock prediction. I explored the basic RNN structure, understood how sequences flow through time, and how information is passed across steps. I also got introduced to LSTMs and why theyâ€™re preferred when longer memory is needed.
